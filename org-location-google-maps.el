;;; Commentary:
;; Integrate google-maps into org-mode.
;;
;; This allows you to press C-c M-l on an Org entry to get the Google Map of
;; your appointment.
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'google-maps)
(require 'org)
(require 'org-agenda)

(defun org-location-google-maps ()
  "Show Google Map for location of an Org entry in an org buffer."
  (interactive)
  (let ((location (org-entry-get nil "LOCATION")))
    (when location
      (google-maps location))))

(define-key org-mode-map "\C-c\M-l" 'org-location-google-maps)

(defun org-agenda-location-google-maps ()
  "Show Google Map for location of an Org entry in an org-agenda buffer."
  (interactive)
  (let ((location
         (save-window-excursion
           (org-agenda-goto)
           (org-entry-get nil "LOCATION"))))
    (when location
